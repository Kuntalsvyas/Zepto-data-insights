# 🛒 Zepto Operational & Sales Analysis (SQL & Excel)

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Zepto’s operational and sales data to extract meaningful business insights. By converting raw, unstructured Excel data into a relational SQL database, I performed end-to-end data engineering to solve critical business problems in the **Quick Commerce** sector. 

The project demonstrates proficiency in data cleaning, schema design, and analytical querying to support real-world decision-making.

## 🗃️ Database Schema
The analysis is performed on a structured relational database designed to handle high-frequency transactional data. Key tables include:
* **Orders & Transactions:** Detailed records of customer purchases and payment methods.
* **Products & Categories:** Catalog management including pricing and inventory types.
* **Customers & Geography:** Demographic data and regional sales distribution.
* **Delivery Operations:** Tracking fulfillment rates and timing.

## 🚀 Key Questions Answered
Through this analysis, I addressed several business-critical questions, including:
* **Revenue Analysis:** Calculating the Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and total revenue.
* **Order Trends:** Counting total orders and identifying peak transaction periods.
* **Category Performance:** Identifying which product categories drive the most sales volume.
* **Average Order Value (AOV):** Calculating the mean spend per transaction across regions.
* **Customer Behavior:** Analyzing payment preferences (UPI, Credit Cards, Cash) and repeat purchase patterns.
* **Regional Insights:** Ranking cities and specific areas by revenue contribution.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated
* **Joins:** Multi-table `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN` for comprehensive data merging.
* **Aggregations:** Using `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING` for metric calculation.
* **Advanced SQL:** Implementation of `CTEs (Common Table Expressions)` and Subqueries.
* **Data Cleaning:** Transforming messy Excel records into standardized CSV formats for SQL ingestion.
